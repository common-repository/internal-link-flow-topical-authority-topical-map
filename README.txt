Visualize and track the internal linking structure of your page using a flow chart. Topical Map and Topical Authority

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to visualize and easily manage the internal linking structure of your page in the form of a flow chart.

If you are linking your articles to each other, you can follow them in the form of a flow chart.

**Topical Map:** This means a map of topics. If you write articles in the form of main topics and subtopics, and link the subtopics to the main topic with a link, you are using this method.

**Topical Authority:** Authority is a measure of credibility, reliability, or believability. This term is the name of a method recently used to increase your organic ranking without external links. I will provide you with a few links on this subject.

== How to use? ==
If you understand the logic of Topical Authority and Topical Map, or if you are proficient in it, it will take you less than 1 minute to learn.

After installing the extension, a **Topical Flow** menu will appear in the left menu. Go to the extension page from this menu. You will see a New Flow button in the upper right corner. Click it to start designing a new flow.
In the left part of the flow design window, you will see Main Topic, Internal Topic and External Topic boxes. Drag and drop them to the left part by using the mouse.

**Main Topic** and **Internal Topic** are for selecting your existing articles. If the topics you want to make the flow for do not exist on your page, you can directly create them from here.

After dragging the **Main Topic** and **Internal Topic** boxes, double-click on the text that says Double-click and search topic. A text box will appear in front of you, you can select the article you want from the list or write the title of the article you want to create and press enter to create it in the form of a draft.

**Main Topic :** Represents your main topic that you target and make money from.

**Internal Topic :** Represents your sub-topics that define your main topic.

**External Link :** Only for viewing your affiliate links or external link links in your main topic or subtopics. Just write your link here and add http:// or https://.

After completing your flow, write the name of your flow in the text box at the top and press the Save button on the right. You can directly click on the editing link and the viewing link of your flow from the flow.

**DELETE :** If you want to delete a *"Node"* or *"Edge"*, simply select it and press the *"Delete"* button on your keyboard.
